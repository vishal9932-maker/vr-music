# How to Publish Your Music Website

Since your website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can easily publish it for free using **Netlify Drop**.

## Option 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)

1.  Go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
2.  Open your file explorer to `c:\Users\vishal6385\Desktop`.
3.  Drag the entire `mus` folder onto the Netlify drop zone.
4.  Wait a few seconds for it to upload.
5.  **Done!** Netlify will give you a live URL (e.g., `optimistic-beaver-12345.netlify.app`) that you can share with anyone.

## Option 2: GitHub Pages (No Code Required)

1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in.
2.  Click the **+** icon in the top right and select **New repository**.
3.  Name it (e.g., `my-music-player`) and click **Create repository**.
4.  Look for the link that says **"uploading an existing file"**. Click it.
5.  Drag all files from your `mus` folder into the browser window.
6.  Wait for them to upload, then click **Commit changes**.
7.  Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
8.  Under **Branch**, select `main` and click **Save**.
9.  Wait a minute, and you will see your live website URL!

## Important Note regarding Local Audio Files
Your website currently uses **local audio files** (mp3s on your computer). 
- When you publish to the web, **these files must be uploaded with the website**.
- The `mus` folder contains all the necessary mp3s, so dragging the whole folder to Netlify (Option 1) will work perfectly!

## How to Watch on Mobile 📱

Once you have your **Netlify URL** (from Option 1):
1.  Copy the link (e.g., `https://optimistic-beaver-12345.netlify.app`).
2.  Send it to yourself (via WhatsApp, Email, etc.).
3.  Open the link on your **Mobile Phone**.
4.  The site will work just like an app!

Enjoy your live website! 🚀
